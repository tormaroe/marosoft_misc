**Pixel_life** is a small framework for creating pixel simulations in a grafical window. The simulations are:

Langton's Ant
-------------
[Langton's Ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant) is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complicated emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells.

The rules are: 

* At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
* At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
