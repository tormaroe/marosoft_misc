**Pixel_life** is a small framework for creating pixel simulations in a grafical window. The simulations are:

Conway's Life
-------------
[Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_life) is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

The rules are:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

Langton's Ant
-------------
[Langton's Ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant) is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complicated emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells.

The rules are: 

* At a white square, turn 90 degrees right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
* At a black square, turn 90 degrees left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
